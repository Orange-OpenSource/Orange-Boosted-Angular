following parameters :</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>homeRoute</code> which is the default route of your application when user clicks the logo link.</li>\\n<li><code>breakpoint</code> which is the bootstrap suffix for when the navbar must collapse to mobile view. Default value is <code>&quot;sm&quot;</code>.\\nCheckout Boosted <a href=\\\"http://boosted.orange.com/v4-alpha/layout/responsive-utilities/#available-classes\\\">documentation</a> for supported values.</li>\\n<li><code>brandPath</code> to specify path and file of the brand logo</li>\\n<li><code>brandLabel</code> to specify alt text for image and link title at the same time</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There is three supported types of child elements to <code>&lt;o-navbar&gt;</code>. Each of them must use native <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> html element.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>o-nav-link</code> for application navigation using Angular router module.</li>\\n<li><code>o-nav-menu</code> for dropdown menu in navbar.</li>\\n<li>classic <code>&lt;a href class=&quot;nav-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> for external links.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h5 id=\\\"onavlink\\\">ONavLink</h5>\\n<p>This component has two parameters :</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>route</code> which the targeted app route, same value as you would use in <code>[routerLink]</code>attribute.</li>\\n<li><code>title</code> which acts as <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag attribute <code>title</code>.
